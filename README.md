🔐 **API Token Security**

If you have an API token:

- **Do NOT share it**
- Treat it like a password
- Keep it private and secure

If someone gains access to your token, they could:

- Add OP or whitelist themselves  
- Modify the MOTD  
- Change server plans  
- Perform other unauthorized actions  

Protect your token at all times.
